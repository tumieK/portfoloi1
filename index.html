I conducted campus tours, answered questions, and provided insight into the unique educational experiences our university offers.</p>

<h2>Lecture’s Assistant (CSIS1664), University of the Free State</h2>

<p>I worked as a lecture assistant for the Introduction to Web Page Development course, which focuses on teaching the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I attended lectures alongside the instructor, assisting students by answering their questions and supporting them with various class activities. In cases where the lecturer was unavailable, I stepped in to offer the lecture.</p>

<h2>Demonstrator (CSIS1606, CSIS1614), University of the Free State</h2>
<p><strong>Year: 2023</strong></p>
<p>I served as a demonstrator for two modules: <em>Introduction to Programming for Engineers</em> and <em>Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving Part 1 & 2</em>. This position was offered to me based on my performance in these modules. I oversaw weekly practical sessions completed by first-year students, assisting them by explaining problems and providing solutions for various programming scenarios.</p>

<h2>Lecture Assistant (BCIS1623), University of the Free State</h2>

<p>I am currently a demonstrator for the Software Design module. This position was offered to me due to my performance in the modules.

<h2>Work Integrated Learning Module (CSIS3784)</h2>
<p><strong>Year: 2024</strong></p>
<p>The university selected the top 12 students, based on their programming marks, to visit BBD for a week of hands-on experience, and I was one of them.
